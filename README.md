# Super-resolved-anomalous-diffusion-code
Code from article https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18133


The file Example_fit_joint_PDF_alpha_D.m is a working example.
Require inputs is an array N x M of M trajectories of N steps, the trajectories must be given in physical units (e.g. micrometer). The frame duration dt (sec) must be given in the script.
The nu√πber of components 'n_peak' must be given.
